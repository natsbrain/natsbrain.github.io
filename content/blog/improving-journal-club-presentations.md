Journal clubs, while being an important part of education in medical fields for a long time, have been picked up by engeering students only lately.
Specially with start of AI boom and flood of new papers in this field, caught everyone by surprise, and it's practically impossible to read each interesting new paper with the amount of time we have each day.
So, there has been a new trend of starting new jounral clubs, specially in computer science &amp; neuroscience, to help students and researchers to get a grasp of what's happening so they don't fall behind new works.
I've been picking some tips on how to present a paper in journal clubs, and I've summerized them here. You can read the full sources, with links down below.

1.  Select a paper for journal club:

    Pretty obvious, isn't it? But you should know what's the purpose of your journal club (JC), who are your audience and what's their expectations.
2.  Learn how to read a paper thoroughly:

    There are some techniques on how to read a paper and I'll explain them another time, but you have to know how to read &amp; summerize a paper thoroughly.
3.  Describe the problem that attracted you to the paper:

    Why did you pickup this paper? What's the big question that this paper answers?
4.  Exaplin how you came across this paper/article:

    Share the keywords or references you used to get to this one, so if anyone's interested, could continue this path.
5.  Describe the question:

    Start broadly, then get specific. What are hypothesis of the paper? What are some other releavant ideas?
6.  State importance/relevance/context of the question:

    What was known at the time? What was not? Explain the gap in the knowledge and how the paper fills it.
7.  Describe the methods:

    Take advantage of the figures. Figures grab more attention and are easier to understand than text. Take notes for each one, and jot these out:

    1.  ****Aim**** of the figure
    2.  ****Method**** used
    3.  ****Results**** being shown
    4.  ****Your**** interpretation of figure
    5.  ****Author's**** interpretation of figure
    6.  ****Contribution**** of this figure to main question
8.  Discuss quesions:

    That's why everyone's here, isn't it? Encourage every one to ask questions and participate in giving answers.
    Also, don't be afraid to voice your own opinion.
9.  Prepare a 1-page summary of the outline as a handout:

    If you have time before starting the JC, prepare a 1-page summary of the paper.
    This could be both be used to direct everyone's attention though headlines, and give a quick grasp of what's coming.

And some subordinate tips, that may seem unnecessary to mention, but are important nontheless:

1.  Avoid jargons/puns/misleading terms.
2.  State the question early, and be sure to answer it.
3.  Tell a clear story, and specially present the results as clear as possible.
4.  Keep consistant terminoglogy throughout your presentation.
5.  Make sure everyone's enjoying the JC sessions!

That's it! Follow these tips and you'll crush your presentations!
